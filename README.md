# Payments App

### About this project
In March of 2024, I was traveling with several friends on a break from school when we ran across a frustrating problem: Splitwise, an app that allows easy tracking of owed money, now had a limit for how many entries a person can add each day. Once the limit is reached, they ask you to upgrade to their paid version to be allowed to add more entries. I resorted to collecting receipts wherever we went, stuffing them into my bag and hoping I didn't lose them. Unfortunately, I did just that - and ended up with quite a few charges on my credit card statement for which I did not know with whom to split. Once I returned from the trip, I decided to solve the problem by writing my own payments app - one that neither I nor my friends would ever have to pay for.
